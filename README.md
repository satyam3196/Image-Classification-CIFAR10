#CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using PyTorch
This repository contains a Python script to train a deep learning model on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification.

###About the Model
The model is based on PyTorch's neural network (nn) module and consists of several blocks, each containing a convolutional layer, batch normalization layer, and PReLU activation function.

The model also uses Adaptive Convolution, which computes channel-wise weights using a fully connected layer and applies the softmax function. These weights are then used for performing adaptive convolutions. The output of these convolutions is added to the output of a residual connection to form the final output of the block.

The model's classifier is a sequence of layers, including an AdaptiveAvgPool2d layer to reduce the spatial dimensions to 1x1, a Flatten layer to convert the tensor into a 1D vector, and a Linear layer to produce the final class scores.

Custom Loss Function
The model uses a custom loss function, LabelSmoothingCrossEntropyLoss, which incorporates label smoothing. This technique can prevent the model from becoming overconfident in its predictions and improve its generalization ability.

Training Process
The model is trained using the RMSprop optimizer with momentum. The learning rate is scheduled using a cosine annealing strategy.

During training, the gradients are accumulated for multiple mini-batches before performing an update step. This technique can be helpful when training deep models with large mini-batch sizes on GPUs with limited memory.

The training and validation losses and accuracies are calculated for each epoch and plotted at the end of the training process.

Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training and testing the model. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'.

How to Run
Make sure to install the required Python libraries (PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib) before running the script.

To run the script, simply execute it using a Python interpreter. Note that the script is configured to use a GPU if one is available, otherwise it will use the CPU.

Results
The training and validation losses and accuracies are plotted at the end of the training process, providing an overview of the model's learning process and performance.

Feel free to explore the script and modify it as you see fit. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
